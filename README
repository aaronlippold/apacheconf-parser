Description:

This is an attempt at building a parser for the apache httpd.conf file format 
using treetop and ruby. This is mainly an exercise in self-education and there 
may be more complete and more robust libraries out there doing exactly the same 
thing only better. This project has no goals of being "production ready" or even
useful in the near future.

Dependencies:

rspec / treetop / rubygems

Installation Instructions:

None yet, you can run the rspec specifications from the /spec subdirectory
